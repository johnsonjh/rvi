# rvi - Revision Control System Interface

`rvi` is an interface to `RCS`.

## Introduction

It attempts to make the process of using `RCS` simple.

## About RCS

Here is an extract from the `rcs` man page:

    "The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple
     revisions of files. RCS automates the storing,
     retrieval, logging, identification, and merging of
     revisions. RCS is useful for text that is revised
     frequently, for example programs, documentation,
     graphics, papers, and form letters."

See the `rcsintro` man page for more details.
