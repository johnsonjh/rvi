Rvi - Revision control system interface

Rvi is an interface to RCS. It attempts to make the process of using RCS
simpler. Here is an extract from the rcs man page.

     " The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of
     files. RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification,
     and merging of revisions. RCS is useful for text that is revised
     frequently, for example programs, documentation, graphics, papers, and
     form letters. "

See rcsintro(1) from more details.
